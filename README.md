Lending-Club-Case-Study

In this case study, we will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

We will be using EDA to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

In other words, we want to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  

The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
